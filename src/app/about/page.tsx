          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be challenging to detect in its
          early stages, but we believe that early intervention is key to
          improving outcomes for children. Our platform leverages
          state-of-the-art machine learning models to analyze images and videos,
          as well as ask insightful questions, to help identify early signs of
          autism.
